  <h1>Yield: Serves 2</h1>

    can San Marzano tomatoes 1ball pizza dough 8ounces fresh mozzarella, cut
    into 1-inch cubes 2tablespoons basil leaves, thinly sliced Extra-virgin
    olive oil, to drizzle Kosher salt Freshly cracked black pepper Grated
    Parmesan, to sprinkle Preparation Step 1 At least 45 minutes before cooking,
    preheat the oven and pizza stone to 550 degrees. Step 2 Drain the tomatoes
    over a fine-mesh strainer, reserving the liquid for another use. Break up
    the tomatoes and drain the juices, pressing them with a wooden spoon. The
    tomatoes should be fairly dry. Step 3 Place the dough on a heavily floured
    surface and stretch and pull, using your hands or a rolling pin, into about
    a 14-inch round. Place on a lightly floured pizza peel or rimless baking
    sheet. Cover with the toppings, being careful not to press on the dough and
    weigh it down: the crushed tomatoes first, then the cheese, leaving roughly
    a Â½-inch border. Shake the pizza peel slightly to make sure the dough is not
    sticking. (Gently lift any sections that are sticking and sprinkle the peel
    with flour.) Carefully slide the pizza directly onto the baking stone in one
    quick, forward-and-back motion. Cook until the crust has browned on the
    bottom and the top is bubbling and browning in spots, about 7 minutes. Top
    with the basil, and season with olive oil, salt, pepper and Parmesan. Serve
    hot. Makes 1 pizza.
